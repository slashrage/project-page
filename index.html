            Congratulations, [NEW DWARVEN EMPLOYEE]! By signing up with DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, you have just taken your first step towards becoming an essential gear in the machine of the MOST TENACIOUS space mining corporation in the known galaxy!
            At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, we pride ourselves on having established practical dominance of some the most lucrative systems in the OUTER RIM. While our foolish and cowardly competitors generally regard these as too volatile or high-risk, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC calls them home.
            At this time, we have a total of 89 ORBITAL SPACE RIGS in operation throughout MORE THAN A DOZEN Outer Rim systems, with 16 MORE currently under construction.
            However, a NEW MANDATE is upon us! While our digs number in the dozens already, we are currently engaged in our most daring and heavily orchestrated mining operation to date: The COMPLETE SUBJUGATION of the planet HOXXES IV. 
            HOXXES IV constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the SINGLE MOST LUCRATIVE mining location in the galaxy, containing the RICHEST AND MOST DENSE concentrations of valuable minerals we have ever encountered. However, it also just happens to be the SINGLE MOST HOSTILE place we have ever mapped. Several competitors before us have tried to tame Hoxxes IV, WITHOUT LUCK.
            DEEP ROCK GALACTIC will succeed. DEEP ROCK GALACTIC is not in the business of failing. 
            <div>MANAGEMENT BIDS YOU WELCOME, NEW MINER.</div> 
            <div>WELCOME ABOARD.</div>
